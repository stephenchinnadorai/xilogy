Its a platform and a new way for people to connect with each other. The idea is, you use your laptop to manage what you are watching on TV by connecting it to your Sky digibox and you can rate, view and change content. You connect yourself with many of the popular networks of communication such as Facebook, Twitter and email. It will contain a smart system that showcases a simple and easy to use way to record tv or set reminders.

Its being developed by three people, all of whom have experience.

And everything should be up and running by September.

Hope to see you soon!
